This project is containing the documentation of prime-ng..

prime-ng is Optimus support for Linux, with real offloading, and not
switchable graphics.. More important.. it works on Optimus Laptops without a
graphical multiplexer..

Version 2.0 of the prime-ng project has been release!!!

The Installation should now be completely automatic...


Now 3D is enabled on both the Intel and the nVidia at the same time..

The Intel card is running the Desktop and the nVidia card can be used for
the thougher applications with the command "optirun32 <application>" or
"optirun64 <application>"...

So now we just need somebody to write an application for automatically
balance which applications should be run on which card.. and shut the nVidia
card down, when not used..

But still I think it is a good step forward...

Just download the install.sh and the install-files folder..

I left the old releases up there in the old/ folder.. if someone needs it..
