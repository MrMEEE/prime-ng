Version v1.3.1

I have found a way to use the nvidia card in machines WITHOUT the optimus
mux...

There are still a few flaws... but in my regard they are few...

This has been testet succesful on:
Machine 		User
Alienware M11X R2 	Martin Juhl
Asus N82Jv 		André Ventura
Acer EeePC 1215N 	Ellington Santos
Asus N61Jv (X64Jv) 	Ted
Acer Aspire 5745PG 	Miguel Belmonte
Dell Vostro 3300 	Peter Liedler
	

First of all I have this running on my Alienware M11X R2, on Ubuntu Natty
11.04 64-bit.. And haven't tried it on any other configurations.. so I hope
you can report back, if it works on other laptops (it should) and other
distributions....


Up's:

We got nvidia acceleration on our Linux games and programs.. wine as well..


Down's:

A few programs doesn't work.. this far I have only found Diablo 2.. which
gives some weird double/single buffer error in wine...

Still not transparent switching like in Window$.. but a big step the right
way..

No acceleration from the Intel card.. so Nvidia 3D or none...

Vdpau doesn't seem to be working..

Drains battery pretty fast...


Further Idea's:

Combine this with the acpi module hack, to get more battery time, when the
Nvidia card is not used.. auto-shutdown??

Maybe a seperate X-server for the Nvidia card is the way to go, so we can
shut that down as well when not used..

Try to get both the Intel and the Nvidia libraries installed at the same
time, so that 3D is enabled for both cards..



Here it goes:

First of all download the following:

General:

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/xorg.conf

32-bit deb-based:

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/turbojpeg_1.11.1_i386.deb

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/VirtualGL_2.2.1_i386.deb

64-bit deb-based:

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/turbojpeg_1.11.1_amd64.deb

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/VirtualGL_2.2.1_amd64.deb

32-bit rpm-based:

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/turbojpeg-1.11.i386.rpm

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/VirtualGL-2.2.1.i386.rpm

64-bit rpm-based:

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/turbojpeg-1.11.x86_64.rpm

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/VirtualGL-2.2.1.x86_64.rpm

Source:

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/turbojpeg-ipp-1.11.1.tar.gz

http://www.martin-juhl.dk/optimus/VirtualGL-2.2.1.tar.gz

Files can also be found here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files/

Ok... Installation:

Start by installing the nvidia driver:

sudo aptitude install nvidia-current     (ubuntu)

then put the xorg.conf in /etc/X11/

It might be necessary to change the “ConnectedMonitor” under the Nvidia-device section and BUSID’s for the Intel and Nvidia Card..

Here is what I got this far:

Laptop 			Intel BusID 	Nvidia BusID 	ConnectedMonitor
Alienware M11X 		PCI:0:2:0 	PCI:1:0:0 	CRT-0
Dell XPS 15 		PCI:0:2:0 	PCI:2:0:0 	CRT-0
Asus N61Jv (X64Jv) 	PCI:0:2:0 	PCI:1:0:0 	CRT-0
Acer EeePC 1215N 	PCI:0:2:0 	PCI:4:0:0 	DFP-0
Acer Aspire 5745PG 	PCI:0:2:0 	PCI:1:0:0 	DFP-0
Dell Vostro 3300 	PCI:0:2:0 	PCI:1:0:0 	DFP-0

after that, install the two files you downloaded above:

sudo dpkg -i turbojpeg*  VirtualGL*        (deb)

or

sudo rpm -ihv turbojpeg*  VirtualGL*     (rpm)

Now run:

sudo vglserver_config

answer as below:

1) Configure server for use with VirtualGL in GLX mode
2) Unconfigure server for use with VirtualGL in GLX mode
X) Exit

Choose:
1

Restrict 3D X server access to vglusers group (recommended)?
[Y/n]
n

Restrict framebuffer device access to vglusers group (recommended)?
[Y/n]
n

Disable XTEST extension (recommended)?
[Y/n]
y
... Creating /etc/modprobe.d/virtualgl.conf to set requested permissions for

... Attempting to remove nvidia module from memory so device permissions

ERROR: Module nvidia is in use

Done. You must restart the display manager for the changes to take effect.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Your system uses modprobe.d to set device permissions. You
must execute rmmod nvidia with the display manager stopped in order for the
new device permission settings to become effective.

1) Configure server for use with VirtualGL in GLX mode
2) Unconfigure server for use with VirtualGL in GLX mode
X) Exit

Choose:
x

Then:

append the following two lines to /etc/profile or to your ~/.bashrc if that
exists..

VGL_DISPLAY=:0.1
export VGL_DISPLAY
VGL_COMPRESS=yuv
export VGL_COMPRESS

Now you need to make sure that your Desktop Enviroment runs the following
command after starting up..

vglclient localhost &

In KDE this is archived by creating:
~/.kde/share/autostart/vglclient.desktop (you might need to create the
autostart folder as well):

[Desktop Entry]
Comment[da]=
Comment=
Exec=vglclient localhost &
GenericName=
Icon=exec
MimeType=
Name=vglclient
Path=
StartupNotify=true
Terminal=false
TerminalOptions=
Type=Application
X-DBUS-ServiceName=
X-DBUS-StartupType=
X-KDE-SubstituteUID=false
X-KDE-Username=
X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=desktop_kdebase


and reboot...

Hopefully your computer comes back up..

now you should be able to start applications with:

vglrun <application>

and the nvidia card will be used for acceleration..

btw. <application> needs to contain the full path to the application if not
in the path...

It is still the Intel card running the rest.. and for now I haven't found a
way to activate acceleration for both cards.. so no fancy compiz effects..
but thats no problem for me, as long as I can use my nvidia card for gaming
:D...

Hope this will help someone..


Nvidia Always on in Gnome or KDE:

This is experimental.. might be unforeseen problems:

KDE:

Create: /usr/share/xsessions/kde-plasma-vgl.desktop:

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Type=XSession
Exec=/usr/bin/startkde-vgl
TryExec=/usr/bin/startkde-vgl
Name=KDE Plasma Workspace Nvidia Accelerated
Comment=The desktop made by KDE

Create: /usr/bin/startkde-vgl:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/vglrun -d :0.1 /usr/bin/startkde

and run:

chmod +x /usr/bin/startkde-vgl

Gnome:

Create: /usr/share/xsessions/gnome-vgl.desktop:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=XSession
Exec=/usr/bin/gnome-session-vgl
TryExec=/usr/bin/gnome-session-vgl
Name=GNOME Nvidia Accelerated
Comment=The GNU Network Object Model Environment. A complete, free and
easy-to-use desktop environment
X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=desktop_kdebase-workspace

Create: /usr/bin/gnome-session-vgl:

#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/vglrun -d :0.1 /usr/bin/gnome-session

and run:

chmod +x /usr/bin/gnome-session-vgl

The Accelerated sessions should now be available in gdm or kdm..

KDE or Gnome doesn't work with Desktop Effects, but everything else seems to work.. (applications are automatically started with the Nvidia card)
